# react-auth

* This is just a basic react-redux application that implements user authentication from a node backend.

* In this app you'll be able to sign up and sign in into restricted components.

_Notes._ This can be used with other backend, but if there's no token used on your choice of backend then you have 
to choose a method of how you want your app to know you're logged in when you refresh the page.
